# YAHOMAS-App
This is the mobile part of main YAHOMAS project. You can see the project here: https://github.com/tugcanolgun/YAHOMAS

> I do not own a Mac. I do not know how it may look on an iPhone.

The main purpose of this app is to provide room personnel of the hotel to easily manage customer requirements.

The features:

* Secure login
* Room listing
* Room cleaning check
* Room availability check
* Instant search of rooms and items
* Item listing
* Adding/deleting items

The following features are there for experimental purposes:

* Room access with NFC
* Room access with QR

These features are to be implemented specifically according to the hotel's requirements. But the main idea is to give the room personnel the access to the rooms via these features as these are going to be logged as any other means of use of this app. Basically, giving one device for all purposes.

## Apk

Unfortunatelly right now there is no available apk or ios built for this app. You can build it using the instruction below.
